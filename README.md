## General Information

- This repository provides a RESTful API that allows users to retrieve a list of provinces and their corresponding cities within Iran. The API serves a comprehensive and accurate dataset, making it easy to access this information for applications that require geographic data related to provinces and cities of Iran. The web API is built with modern web technologies to ensure efficient and scalable access.
- Many applications and projects need reliable geographic information about Iran's provinces and cities for various purposes such as:
  - User registration forms that require location-based input.
  - Logistics and delivery services that need to validate and track locations.
  - Administrative and governmental projects where geographical regions need to be organized.
- Currently, developers might struggle to find up-to-date and easily accessible APIs with Iran-specific geographical data. This API provides a simple solution by offering accurate and structured information in a standardized format.
- The main goal of this project is to create a lightweight and accessible web API that can be integrated into any project requiring Iranian geographic data. By using this API, developers can:
  - Simplify the process of managing geographical data.
  - Facilitate the development of localized apps and services that need this specific data.
  - Reduce the need for manually maintaining or updating large datasets of provinces and cities.
